Basically, I'm a Bangalorean, love traveling, and am an aspiring author to make my fantasy into a book. 
I am also a passionate, disciplined, and efficient technical writer and editor with five and half years of experience in software products. 
As a technical writer, my portfolio includes creating various technical documentation such as user manuals, installation guides, configuration guides, online help files, troubleshooting guides, web content, and video creation for IT products. 
Apart from technical writing, I got a certification in JavaScript, and an agile project management crash course.
